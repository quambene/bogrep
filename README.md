## Install Bogrep

### Install Bogrep from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bogrep)

``` bash
# Build and install bogrep binary to ~/.cargo/bin; settings and cache are installed to ~/.config/bogrep
cargo install bogrep
```

### Install Bogrep from [github.com](https://github.com/quambene/bogrep)

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:quambene/bogrep.git
cd bogrep

# Build and install bogrep binary to ~/.cargo/bin; settings and cache are installed to ~/.config/bogrep
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

``` bash
# Configure the path to the bookmarks file (e.g. of your browser)
bogrep config --source "my/path/to/bookmarks_file.json"

# Import bookmarks
bogrep import

# Fetch and cache bookmarks
bogrep fetch

# Search your bookmarks in full-text search
bogrep <pattern>
```

## Getting help

``` bash
# Check version
bogrep --version

# Print help
bogrep --help

# Print help for subcommands
bogrep config --help
bogrep import --help
bogrep fetch --help
```

## Import bookmarks

The path of bookmarks may be different for your operating system.

### Firefox

Configure Firefox as source for bookmarks, where `<my_profile>` is your Firefox profile:

``` bash
# snap package
bogrep config --source ~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/<my_profile>/bookmarkbackups

# apt package
bogrep config --source ~/.mozilla/firefox/<my_profile>/bookmarkbackups
```

Directory `bookmarkbackups` contains multiple backups files, and `bogrep` will
choose the most recent bookmarks file.

### Chrome

Configure Chrome as source for bookmarks:

``` bash
bogrep config --source ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/bookmarks
```

### Specify bookmark folders

Specify which bookmark folders are imported. Multiple folders are separated by comma:

``` bash
bogrep config --source "my/path/to/bookmarks_file.json" --folders dev,science,articles
```

## Ignore urls

Ignore specific urls. The content for these urls will not be fetched and cached.

It can be useful to ignore urls for video or music platforms which
usually don't include relevant text to grep.

``` bash
# Ignore one or more urls
bogrep ignore <url1> <url2> ...
```

## Diff websites

Fetch difference between cached and fetched website for multiple urls, and display changes:

``` bash
bogrep fetch --diff <url1> <url2> ...
```

## Request throttling

Fetching of bookmarks from the same host is conservatively throttled, but can
also be configured in the `settings.json` usually
placed at `~/.config/bogrep` in your home directory:

``` json
{
    "cache_mode": "text",
    "max_concurrent_requests": 100,
    "request_timeout": 60000,
    "request_throttling": 3000
}
```

where `request_throttling` is the waiting time between requests for the same
host in milliseconds.

## Supported operating systems

Bogrep assumes a configuration path at `~/.config/bogrep` in your home directory
for storing the `settings.json`, `bookmarks.json`, and `cache` folder. This
should work for most Linux derivatives. Feel free to open an issue if you need
support for macOS or Windows.

## Testing

``` bash
# Run unit tests
cargo run

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test '*' --features integration-test
```
